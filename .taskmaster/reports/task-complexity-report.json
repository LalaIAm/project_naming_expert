			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Monorepo and Project Scaffolding",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the initialization of the monorepo into subtasks covering: Yarn Workspaces setup, backend scaffolding (Express, TypeORM, PostgreSQL), frontend scaffolding (Vite, React), root-level script configuration, dependency management, code quality tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Husky), and verification/testing of the setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple frameworks and tools, cross-package coordination, and code quality automation. Each component (backend, frontend, tooling) requires distinct setup steps and integration, making the overall complexity above average but not extreme."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication and User Management",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for user schema design, registration endpoint, login endpoint, password reset, JWT integration, Redis session management, SendGrid email integration, refresh token rotation, logout logic, and comprehensive integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers secure authentication, session management, email workflows, and integration with multiple external services. Security, correctness, and test coverage are critical, increasing both technical and organizational complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Project Creation and Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for project schema design, CRUD API endpoints, backend validation, frontend form implementation, React Query integration, progress tracking logic, Redis caching, and unit/integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires full-stack CRUD, state management, caching, and robust validation. It spans both backend and frontend, with data consistency and performance considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Multi-Phase Wizard and Onboarding Flow",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for wizard component architecture, phase navigation logic, progress indicator UI, onboarding tutorial backend, frontend tutorial display, progress persistence, and end-to-end testing.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves complex UI state, user experience flows, backend integration for tutorials, and persistent progress tracking, but is focused on a single user-facing feature set."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate AI-Driven Audience Research and Strategy Workflows",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for schema design (questionnaire/persona/competitor), OpenAI API integration, async job queue setup, endpoint implementation, report generation, PDF export, data persistence, versioning, frontend integration, and workflow testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task integrates advanced AI workflows, async processing, complex data structures, and report generation, requiring careful orchestration and error handling across multiple subsystems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Brand Identity and Visual Asset Generation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for each AI generation endpoint (brand name, voice, story, tagline, logo, color palette), DALLÂ·E and Stable Diffusion integration, image post-processing, asset storage, ZIP export, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines multiple AI models, image processing, asset management, and export logic, each with unique integration and validation requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Brand Positioning and Collaboration Features",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for schema design (positioning, feedback, collaborators), AI endpoint implementation, feedback loop logic, invitation and comment endpoints, real-time notification setup, role/permission management, and testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task blends AI-driven content, real-time collaboration, and complex role management, requiring both backend and frontend coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up CI/CD Pipeline and Infrastructure Automation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for GitHub Actions workflow creation, Dockerization, AWS ECS deployment, Terraform infrastructure provisioning, S3/CloudFront setup, Redis provisioning, Datadog monitoring, and pipeline testing.",
