# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Maintenance and Support Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Build a dashboard for managing maintenance tasks and notifications for system administrators.
# Details:
Design maintenance task schema with PostgreSQL and TypeORM. Implement REST API endpoints for task CRUD operations. Create React dashboard with Tailwind CSS and React Query for task management. Integrate notification system with Redis Pub/Sub and SendGrid for email alerts.

# Test Strategy:
Test maintenance task creation, status updates, and notification delivery. Validate dashboard UI and API integration.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Maintenance Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and document the database schema to support maintenance records, including tables, fields, relationships, and constraints.
### Details:
Include entities such as maintenance tasks, users, notifications, and logs. Ensure the schema supports CRUD operations and notification tracking.

## 2. Develop REST API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on maintenance records and notification management.
### Details:
Follow REST best practices: use plural nouns for resources, appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), JSON payloads, and proper status codes. Secure endpoints and provide documentation.

## 3. Build React Dashboard UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create a React-based dashboard for users to view, create, update, and delete maintenance records and manage notifications.
### Details:
Design modular components for listing, editing, and viewing maintenance tasks. Integrate with the REST API and ensure responsive, accessible UI.

## 4. Integrate Notification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Implement a notification system to alert users of maintenance events via in-app messages and/or push notifications.
### Details:
Connect the backend notification logic to the React dashboard. Ensure real-time or near-real-time updates using websockets or polling as appropriate.

## 5. Set Up Email Alert Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Configure backend logic to send email alerts for relevant maintenance events and notifications.
### Details:
Integrate with an email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, SES). Ensure emails are triggered by specific events and include relevant details.

## 6. Implement End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Develop and execute end-to-end tests covering the full workflow: schema, API, UI, notifications, and email alerts.
### Details:
Use testing frameworks to simulate user actions and verify system behavior across all layers. Ensure tests cover edge cases and notification delivery.
