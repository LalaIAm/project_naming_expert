# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Authentication and User Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop user registration, login, password reset, and session management with JWT, Redis, and SendGrid.
# Details:
Design PostgreSQL user schema with email, hashed password, and verification status. Implement POST /api/auth/signup, POST /api/auth/login, POST /api/auth/password-reset endpoints with Joi validation, bcrypt (bcryptjs@2.x) for password hashing, and JWT (jsonwebtoken@9.x) for tokens. Use Redis (redis@4.x) for token blacklist and session caching. Integrate SendGrid (sendgrid@7.x) for email verification and password reset. Secure tokens in HttpOnly cookies. Implement refresh token rotation and logout logic.

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests for signup, login, password reset, and logout endpoints using Jest (jest@29.x) and Supertest (supertest@6.x). Test token rotation, session invalidation, and email delivery.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design User Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the user schema to include fields for email, name, password, verification status, reset OTP, reset OTP expiration, and role assignment.
### Details:
Ensure the schema supports unique emails, secure password storage, a boolean 'isVerified' field, fields for password reset (OTP and expiration), and a reference to user roles for permissions management.

## 2. Implement Registration Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create an endpoint to handle new user registrations, including input validation and initial user creation.
### Details:
Validate required fields, hash passwords, set default values (e.g., isVerified: false), and store the new user in the database.

## 3. Implement Login Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop an endpoint for user authentication using email and password.
### Details:
Verify credentials, check verification status, and prepare for JWT issuance upon successful authentication.

## 4. Implement Password Reset Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Enable users to request and complete password resets using OTPs.
### Details:
Generate and store OTPs and expiration times, send OTPs via email, and allow users to reset their password upon OTP validation.

## 5. Integrate JWT Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Issue and validate JWTs for authenticated sessions.
### Details:
Generate JWTs on login, validate tokens on protected endpoints, and handle token expiration securely.

## 6. Implement Redis Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Use Redis to manage user sessions and store refresh tokens.
### Details:
Store session data and refresh tokens in Redis for efficient session validation and revocation.

## 7. Integrate SendGrid for Email Delivery [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.4
### Description: Set up SendGrid to send verification and password reset emails.
### Details:
Configure SendGrid API, implement email templates, and trigger emails for account verification and password resets.

## 8. Implement Refresh Token Rotation and Logout Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Securely rotate refresh tokens and handle user logout.
### Details:
On refresh, issue new tokens and invalidate old ones in Redis; on logout, remove session and tokens from Redis.

## 9. Develop Comprehensive Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8
### Description: Write integration tests covering registration, login, password reset, JWT, session management, email delivery, token rotation, and logout.
### Details:
Ensure all authentication flows, security checks, and external integrations are tested for correctness and robustness.
