# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design and Implement Project Creation and Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable users to create, view, edit, and delete branding projects with industry selection and progress tracking.
# Details:
Design project schema with fields for name, description, industry, userId, createdAt using TypeORM. Implement POST /api/projects, GET /api/projects, PUT /api/projects/:id, DELETE /api/projects/:id endpoints with Joi validation. Use React Hook Form (react-hook-form@7.x) and Tailwind CSS (tailwindcss@3.x) for frontend forms. Integrate with React Query (react-query@4.x) for data fetching and mutation. Store progress and saved work in PostgreSQL with Redis caching for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit and integration tests for project CRUD endpoints and frontend components. Test project creation, editing, deletion, and progress tracking.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Project Data Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the database schema for the core entities, including fields, types, relationships, and constraints to support CRUD operations.
### Details:
Create an ERD or equivalent schema definition for the main project entity and any related entities. Ensure normalization and support for future extensibility.

## 2. Implement CRUD API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the project entity.
### Details:
Set up backend routes for each CRUD operation, following REST conventions. Ensure endpoints are documented and return appropriate status codes and error messages.

## 3. Add Backend Validation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement server-side validation for all incoming data to the CRUD endpoints, enforcing schema constraints and business rules.
### Details:
Use validation libraries or custom logic to check required fields, data types, and any business-specific rules before processing requests.

## 4. Implement Redis Caching Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Integrate Redis to cache frequently accessed project data and improve API performance.
### Details:
Identify cacheable endpoints (e.g., project list, project details), implement cache set/get/invalidate logic, and ensure cache consistency with database updates.

## 5. Develop Frontend Form Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3
### Description: Build reusable React form components for creating and editing project entities, including field validation and error display.
### Details:
Design forms with controlled components, validation feedback, and accessibility in mind. Ensure forms map to the backend schema and validation rules.

## 6. Integrate React Query for Data Fetching and Mutation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.5
### Description: Use React Query to manage API calls, caching, and state synchronization for project data in the frontend.
### Details:
Set up React Query hooks for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting projects. Handle loading, error, and success states, and ensure UI updates reflect backend changes.

## 7. Implement Progress Tracking Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6
### Description: Add logic to track and display the progress of project entities, both in the backend (data model) and frontend (UI components).
### Details:
Define progress fields in the schema, update endpoints and forms to handle progress updates, and create UI elements (e.g., progress bars) to visualize status.

## 8. Write Unit and Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
### Description: Develop comprehensive tests for backend validation, API endpoints, caching logic, and frontend components to ensure correctness and reliability.
### Details:
Write unit tests for validation and business logic, integration tests for API endpoints (including Redis caching), and frontend tests for form behavior and React Query integration.
