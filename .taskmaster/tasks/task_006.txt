# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Brand Identity and Visual Asset Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Enable AI-powered brand name, voice, story, tagline, logo, and color palette generation with DALL·E and Stable Diffusion as a Phase 2 enhancement after validating audience research capabilities.
# Details:
This feature will be implemented after validating the audience research AI capabilities. When implemented, it will include POST /generate-brand-names, POST /voice-profile, POST /brand-story-draft, POST /taglines/generate endpoints with OpenAI GPT-4 and DALL·E (openai@4.x) integration. Use Stable Diffusion API for visual asset generation. Store selected logos and color palettes in PostgreSQL. Implement image stitching and post-processing with Sharp (sharp@0.x). Export brand kit as ZIP with logo files, color codes, and typography recommendations.

# Test Strategy:
When implemented in Phase 2, test brand name, voice, story, tagline, logo, and color palette generation. Validate image stitching, export, and asset storage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Brand Name Generation Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an API endpoint that generates brand names using AI models.
### Details:
Select or fine-tune an LLM for creative brand name generation. Ensure input validation and output formatting.

## 2. Implement Voice Generation Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an endpoint for generating brand voice or tone guidelines using AI.
### Details:
Define prompt templates for voice/tone. Integrate with an LLM and structure the output for downstream use.

## 3. Implement Story Generation Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an endpoint that produces brand stories or narratives via AI.
### Details:
Design prompts for storytelling. Ensure the endpoint can handle context and brand-specific details.

## 4. Implement Tagline Generation Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build an API endpoint for generating catchy taglines using AI.
### Details:
Optimize prompt engineering for concise, creative outputs. Validate for uniqueness and relevance.

## 5. Implement Logo Generation Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up an endpoint that generates logos using DALL·E and Stable Diffusion models.
### Details:
Integrate with both DALL·E and Stable Diffusion APIs. Handle prompt construction and image output.

## 6. Implement Color Palette Generation Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an endpoint for generating brand color palettes using AI.
### Details:
Use AI to suggest harmonious color schemes. Output in standard formats (e.g., HEX, RGB).

## 7. Integrate DALL·E and Stable Diffusion for Image Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Develop logic to select and route image generation requests to DALL·E or Stable Diffusion as needed.
### Details:
Handle API authentication, error management, and model selection based on input or user preference.

## 8. Implement Image Post-Processing Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop post-processing steps for generated images (e.g., resizing, background removal, format conversion).
### Details:
Use image processing libraries to standardize outputs and enhance quality for various use cases.

## 9. Implement Asset Storage System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.8
### Description: Design and implement a storage solution for all generated assets (text and images).
### Details:
Choose between cloud or local storage. Ensure assets are organized, retrievable, and secure.

## 10. Develop ZIP Export and Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable users to export all assets as a ZIP file and perform end-to-end testing of the entire workflow.
### Details:
Bundle assets, generate ZIP archives, and validate with automated and manual tests for correctness and robustness.
