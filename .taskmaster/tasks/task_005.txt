# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate AI-Driven Audience Research and Strategy Workflows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement AI-powered questionnaire, persona generation, competitor analysis, and strategy framework builder using OpenAI GPT-4, focusing on rapid AI validation and user feedback collection.
# Details:
Design JSONB schema for questionnaire, persona, and competitor data. Implement POST /questionnaire, POST /persona-summary, POST /competitor-data endpoints with OpenAI GPT-4 API integration (openai@4.x). Use BullMQ (bullmq@4.x) and Redis for async job queues and caching. Generate actionable insights and exportable reports using PDFKit (pdfkit@1.x). Store strategy framework and versioning in PostgreSQL. Focus on audience research questionnaire → AI persona generation → insights workflow as the core differentiator, with minimal dependencies on basic auth and simple project storage.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI questionnaire, persona generation, competitor analysis, and report export. Validate data persistence and async job processing. Collect user feedback on AI-generated outputs to refine the system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Schema for Questionnaire, Persona, and Competitor Data [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and document database schemas for questionnaire responses, user personas, and competitor profiles, ensuring support for complex attributes and relationships.
### Details:
Include fields for demographics, psychographics, goals, strategies, and strengths/weaknesses for competitor personas[1][3][5]. Ensure extensibility for future data types.

## 2. Implement Data Persistence Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the backend logic and database integration to persist questionnaire, persona, and competitor data according to the designed schema.
### Details:
Choose appropriate storage (SQL/NoSQL) and implement CRUD operations for all entities.

## 3. Integrate OpenAI API for AI Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Set up secure integration with the OpenAI API to enable AI-driven analysis, persona generation, and report drafting.
### Details:
Implement authentication, error handling, and prompt engineering for relevant tasks[2].

## 4. Set Up Asynchronous Job Queue [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Establish an async job queue system to handle long-running tasks such as AI processing, report generation, and PDF export.
### Details:
Configure concurrency, retries, and error logging for robust background processing[2].

## 5. Implement API Endpoints for Data Submission and Retrieval [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.4
### Description: Develop RESTful or GraphQL endpoints for submitting questionnaires, retrieving personas, and accessing competitor data.
### Details:
Ensure endpoints trigger async jobs where needed and return appropriate statuses.

## 6. Develop Report Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Create backend logic to synthesize data and AI outputs into comprehensive reports, ready for export.
### Details:
Support customizable report sections and integrate AI-generated summaries[2].

## 7. Implement PDF Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable conversion of generated reports into PDF format and provide secure download or storage options.
### Details:
Ensure formatting consistency and handle large document exports efficiently[2].

## 8. Add Versioning Support for Data and Reports [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.6
### Description: Implement version control for questionnaire schemas, personas, competitor data, and generated reports.
### Details:
Allow users to access previous versions and support rollback or comparison features[2].

## 9. Integrate Backend with Frontend Application [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5, 5.7
### Description: Connect frontend components to backend endpoints for seamless data entry, report viewing, and PDF download.
### Details:
Ensure real-time feedback for async tasks and error handling in the UI.

## 10. Test End-to-End Workflow and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of the entire workflow, including AI integration, async processing, data persistence, and report export.
### Details:
Simulate edge cases, validate error recovery, and ensure all subsystems interact as expected[2][4].
