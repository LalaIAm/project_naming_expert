# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Multi-Phase Wizard and Onboarding Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a simplified wizard component for the AI-First MVP approach, focusing on a single-page AI questionnaire to persona generation workflow with basic progress indicators.
# Details:
Create a minimal viable React wizard component using internal state for basic navigation. Implement simple progress indicators with Tailwind CSS. Focus on supporting the audience research workflow without complex phase management. Prioritize rapid AI feature testing over complex multi-phase navigation. Store essential user progress in PostgreSQL.

# Test Strategy:
Test basic wizard navigation, simple progress tracking, and AI questionnaire workflow. Validate transitions between questionnaire and persona generation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Wizard Component Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement the modular structure for the wizard, breaking down the UI into logical, reusable components for each step and the overall container.
### Details:
Establish a parent wizard component that manages state and navigation, and child components for each phase. Ensure components receive necessary props and can communicate state changes upward.

## 2. Implement Phase Navigation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the logic to handle navigation between wizard phases, including next, previous, and conditional branching if required.
### Details:
Ensure navigation functions are passed to child components. Handle edge cases such as first/last step and validation before advancing. Support for dynamic step flows if needed.

## 3. Develop Progress Indicator UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a clear and responsive progress indicator that visually communicates the user's current position and remaining steps in the wizard.
### Details:
Implement a progress bar, stepper, or numbered indicator. Integrate with wizard state to update in real time as the user navigates. Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness.

## 4. Build Onboarding Tutorial Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement backend endpoints and data models to serve onboarding tutorial content and track user progress.
### Details:
Create APIs to fetch tutorial steps, content, and persist user progress. Ensure endpoints are secure and scalable. Consider future extensibility for additional tutorials.

## 5. Implement Frontend Tutorial Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.4
### Description: Integrate backend tutorial data into the frontend, displaying content contextually within the wizard and handling user interactions.
### Details:
Fetch tutorial content from the backend and render it in the appropriate wizard steps. Provide contextual help, tooltips, or overlays as needed. Ensure seamless UX.

## 6. Enable Progress Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4
### Description: Implement mechanisms to persist user progress through the wizard, allowing for session recovery and continuity.
### Details:
Use local storage, cookies, or backend persistence to save the user's current step and entered data. Restore state on reload or return. Handle data privacy and integrity.

## 7. Conduct End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.6
### Description: Develop and execute comprehensive end-to-end tests covering all wizard flows, progress indicators, tutorial integration, and persistence features.
### Details:
Write automated tests simulating user interactions across all phases. Validate navigation, UI updates, backend integration, and data persistence. Address edge cases and regressions.
