# Task ID: 8
# Title: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline and Infrastructure Automation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments to AWS ECS. Provision infrastructure with Terraform.
# Details:
Create GitHub Actions workflow for linting, testing, and deploying to AWS ECS. Use Docker (docker@20.x) for containerization. Provision ECS clusters, S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, and Redis instances with Terraform (terraform@1.x). Implement health checks and monitoring with Datadog (datadog-api-client@2.x).

# Test Strategy:
Test CI/CD pipeline with automated builds, tests, and deployments. Validate infrastructure provisioning and monitoring.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Create GitHub Actions Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a modular and reusable GitHub Actions workflow YAML file to automate CI/CD processes, including triggers, jobs, and steps for code checkout, build, and test.
### Details:
Define workflow structure, triggers (e.g., push, pull request), and modular jobs for building and testing the application. Ensure best practices for reusability and maintainability are followed.

## 2. Dockerize Application [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a Dockerfile and related configuration to containerize the application, ensuring compatibility with AWS ECS deployment requirements.
### Details:
Write and test a Dockerfile, build the Docker image locally, and verify that the application runs as expected in a containerized environment.

## 3. Provision AWS Infrastructure with Terraform [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Write Terraform code to provision core AWS resources, including VPC, subnets, ECS cluster, IAM roles, and security groups.
### Details:
Develop Terraform modules and configuration files to automate the creation of foundational AWS infrastructure required for ECS and related services.

## 4. Set Up S3 Bucket and CloudFront Distribution [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Configure Terraform to provision an S3 bucket for static assets and a CloudFront distribution for content delivery.
### Details:
Define Terraform resources for S3 and CloudFront, set appropriate permissions, and configure cache behaviors and origins.

## 5. Provision Redis Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Add Terraform resources to provision a managed Redis instance (e.g., AWS ElastiCache) and configure networking and access.
### Details:
Define Redis cluster parameters, subnet group, security groups, and ensure connectivity from ECS tasks.

## 6. Integrate Datadog Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.5
### Description: Configure Datadog monitoring for the deployed infrastructure and application, including ECS, Redis, and CloudFront metrics.
### Details:
Set up Datadog agents, define monitors and dashboards, and ensure integration with AWS resources via Terraform and environment variables.

## 7. Deploy Application to AWS ECS [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.5
### Description: Automate deployment of the Dockerized application to AWS ECS using the GitHub Actions workflow and Terraform outputs.
### Details:
Push Docker image to ECR, update ECS task definition and service, and verify deployment via ECS console or CLI.

## 8. Test and Validate CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.7, 8.6
### Description: Run end-to-end tests to validate the entire pipeline, including build, deployment, infrastructure provisioning, and monitoring integration.
### Details:
Trigger pipeline runs, verify successful execution of all stages, and check application health, infrastructure status, and monitoring alerts.
