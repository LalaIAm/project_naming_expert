# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Brand Positioning and Collaboration Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop AI-driven USP finder, positioning statement wizard, value proposition refinement, and collaboration tools as part of Phase 2/3 after validating core audience research AI capabilities.
# Details:
This task is deferred to follow the validation of core audience research workflow. When implemented, design schema for positioning statements, feedback, and collaborator roles. Implement POST /generate-positioning-statement, POST /feedback, POST /api/invitations, POST /comments endpoints with OpenAI GPT-4 integration. Use Redis Pub/Sub for real-time notifications. Manage collaborator roles and permissions with PostgreSQL and TypeORM.

# Test Strategy:
Once development begins, test positioning statement generation, feedback loop, collaborator invitations, comments, and role management. Validate real-time notifications.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive schema to support positioning, feedback, collaborator relationships, roles, permissions, invitations, comments, and notifications.
### Details:
Define tables/entities for users, positions, feedback, collaborators, roles, permissions, invitations, comments, and notifications. Ensure relationships and indexing support real-time collaboration and access control.

## 2. Implement AI Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop and deploy the AI endpoint responsible for content generation, analysis, or feedback processing.
### Details:
Set up the API endpoint, integrate with the AI model, and ensure secure, scalable access. Validate input/output formats and error handling.

## 3. Develop Feedback Loop Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement backend logic to handle user feedback, update AI models or content, and close the feedback loop.
### Details:
Design endpoints and background jobs to process feedback, trigger AI retraining or content updates, and notify relevant users of changes.

## 4. Build Collaborator and Role Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create endpoints and logic for managing collaborators, assigning roles, and enforcing permissions.
### Details:
Implement APIs for inviting collaborators, assigning roles, and checking permissions on actions. Integrate with the schema for access control.

## 5. Develop Invitation and Comment Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Implement endpoints for sending invitations to collaborators and managing threaded comments on content.
### Details:
Create RESTful APIs for sending, accepting, and revoking invitations, as well as posting, editing, and deleting comments. Ensure permissions are enforced.

## 6. Set Up Real-Time Notification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Implement infrastructure for real-time notifications on feedback, comments, invitations, and role changes.
### Details:
Use WebSockets or a push notification service to deliver updates instantly to users. Integrate with the backend to trigger notifications on relevant events.

## 7. Integrate Role and Permission Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4, 7.6
### Description: Ensure all endpoints and UI components enforce role-based access control and permissions.
### Details:
Implement middleware or service logic to check user roles and permissions before allowing actions. Test for privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

## 8. Comprehensive Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7
### Description: Develop and execute tests for all endpoints, real-time features, AI integration, and permission logic.
### Details:
Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Validate schema integrity, endpoint correctness, real-time updates, and security of role/permission enforcement.
