# Task ID: 10
# Title: Optimize Performance, SEO, and Accessibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement code-splitting, lazy loading, prerendering, and accessibility enhancements for the frontend.
# Details:
Use Vite for code-splitting and lazy loading of React components. Implement prerendering or static snapshots for SEO using Next.js (next@14.x) or custom solution. Add ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and WCAG-compliant styling with Tailwind CSS. Test with Lighthouse and axe-core (axe-core@4.x).

# Test Strategy:
Test performance with Lighthouse, validate accessibility with axe-core, and check SEO with Google Search Console.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Code-Splitting and Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor the frontend codebase to use route-based and component-based code splitting with lazy loading, ensuring only essential components are loaded initially.
### Details:
Use React.lazy and Suspense for dynamic imports. Prioritize route-based code splitting for major routes and component-based splitting for large or non-essential components. Avoid lazy loading critical UI elements to maintain user experience.[1][2][3][4]

## 2. Set Up Prerendering and Static Snapshot Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Configure the build process to prerender key pages and generate static HTML snapshots to improve load times and SEO.
### Details:
Integrate tools or frameworks that support static site generation or prerendering. Ensure that dynamic routes and lazy-loaded components are correctly handled in the prerendered output.

## 3. Enhance SEO Metadata and Structured Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Add and validate SEO-relevant metadata, structured data, and semantic HTML to all pages and components.
### Details:
Ensure each page has unique titles, meta descriptions, canonical tags, and Open Graph/Twitter metadata. Use semantic HTML elements and add JSON-LD structured data where appropriate.

## 4. Improve Accessibility with ARIA and Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Audit and enhance accessibility by adding appropriate ARIA attributes and ensuring full keyboard navigation support.
### Details:
Review interactive components for ARIA roles, labels, and states. Ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard and focus management is handled correctly.

## 5. Apply WCAG-Compliant Styling [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Update styles to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for color contrast, focus indicators, and text scalability.
### Details:
Check and adjust color contrast ratios, ensure visible focus outlines, and support user font scaling. Use accessible color palettes and test with common assistive technologies.

## 6. Automate Lighthouse and axe-core Accessibility Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Integrate Lighthouse and axe-core into the CI pipeline to automatically test for performance, accessibility, and SEO issues.
### Details:
Set up automated runs of Lighthouse and axe-core on build or deployment. Review and address any reported issues, focusing on accessibility and SEO metrics.

## 7. Validate SEO Enhancements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform manual and automated validation of SEO improvements using tools like Google Search Console, Lighthouse, and third-party SEO analyzers.
### Details:
Check for correct indexing, rich results, and metadata rendering. Validate that prerendered content and lazy-loaded components are discoverable by search engines.
