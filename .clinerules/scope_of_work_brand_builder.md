# Project Brand Builder

## Executive Summary

This project is a multi-phase brand strategy and identity development application built with a React frontend and Node.js backend. The frontend uses pure React with a top-level wizard component managing phase navigation and state, leveraging React Router or internal state for smooth transitions. React Query handles API data fetching and caching, while Redux Toolkit manages global state such as user and session data. Performance optimizations include code-splitting and lazy loading of components. For SEO, prerendering or static snapshots are considered to enhance discoverability despite client-side rendering. The backend follows a monorepo structure with Express API routes, a controller-service-repository pattern, and robust security including JWT authentication and rate limiting. AI workflows are integrated for audience research, strategy formulation, identity design, positioning, and asset generation, supported by asynchronous job queues and caching layers. The app guides users through structured workflows with AI-generated insights, competitor analysis, and comprehensive report generation to support effective brand building.
